# Welcome to Whistlepost

Whistlepost is a Web publishing platform built on the innovative [Apache Sling](https://sling.apache.org) project.

Using the powerful Sling templating
and model frameworks, Whistlepost provides a simple, but powerful approach to building and maintaining Web applications, Websites and more.

## Getting Started

The simplest way to try Whistlepost is to clone the [whistlepost-launcher](https://github.com/whistlepost/whistlepost-launcher) repository and run:

    $ make build launch

If you don't have `make` installed (e.g. on Windows, etc.), you can also run:

    $ ./mvnw build launch # use: mvnw.cmd for Windows

This will provide you with a Whistlepost instance accessible at [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
